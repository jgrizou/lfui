Learning from Unlabelled Instructions
===

If you do not have any idea about what this code do, you can visit [this](http://jgrizou.com/projects/learning-from-unlabelled-instructions/) page. 

There is only one example for now and it will explain you how to run one experiment with the current code. Run the example/init.m script first which setup the matlab path and change some default figure thingies. Then you can open the example/gridworld/run_gridworld.m script and either have fun reading it or just run it to look at some stuff moving!

Many of the tools you will see are still under test and development, I am here thinking of some classifiers I never used yet. Appart from the provided example which has been tested many times, it is likely there is some buggy code and even wrong one. So be your own guide and check whether what you see make sense. I will do my best to answer any question.
